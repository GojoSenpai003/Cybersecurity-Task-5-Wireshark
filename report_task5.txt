Task 5 – Wireshark Protocol Analysis Report

Protocols Identified:
1. DNS (Domain Name System)
   - Function: Translates domain names to IP addresses.
   - Packet Type: Query and Response
   - Example: Query for "google.com" with a response IP.

2. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
   - Function: Reliable, ordered communication.
   - Packet Type: SYN, ACK, FIN, data packets.
   - Example: 3-way handshake observed with destination port 80/443.

3. HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)
   - Function: Used for loading web pages.
   - Packet Type: GET and Response.
   - Example: GET request to `example.com`.

Filtering Used:
- `dns` → Showed DNS queries/responses
- `tcp` → Showed connection-level traffic
- `http` → Showed HTTP GET and responses

Observations:
- DNS queries were triggered immediately on typing a domain.
- TCP handshake was observed before data transmission.
- HTTP requests followed successful TCP setup.
